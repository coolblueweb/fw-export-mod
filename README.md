#Fireworks Export Moddifcation for coolblueweb

This is a modification of the fireworks default <em>DEFAULT DREAMWEAVER</em> export for Fireworks.

*italics*Always make a backup of the original file before using this one, as it might break the export for fireworks for you.*italics*

##Also always check to make sure you're using the right export method in the options for the table.

I'm sure that you can use it in place of Generic HTML but to be sure replace the <strong>SLICES.XTT</strong> in the dreamweaver folder which you can find here:

	/Applications/Adobe\ Fireworks\ CS6/Configuration/HTML\ Code/Dreamweaver
