#Fireworks Export Moddifcation for coolblueweb

This is a modification of the fireworks default <em>DEFAULT DREAMWEAVER</em> export for Fireworks.

<sub><sup<em>*Always make a backup of the original file before using this one, as it might break the export for fireworks for you.</em></sup></sub>

##Where to put it...

be sure replace the <strong>SLICES.XTT</strong> in the dreamweaver folder which you can find here:

	/Applications/Adobe\ Fireworks\ CS6/Configuration/HTML\ Code/Dreamweaver

<sub><sup>You can probably use it in the other export types but to be safe this is where it is working for me.</sup></sub>
