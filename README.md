#Fireworks Export Moddifcation for coolblueweb

This is a modification of the fireworks <strong><em>DEFAULT DREAMWEAVER</em></strong> export for Fireworks. <strong>Always make a backup of the original file before using this one, as it might break the export for fireworks for you.</strong>

The link tag is generalized I usually just have a style sheet in the main directory, the script being called is for google analytics so we can track when a client views the page. The include is for the global nav if you hadn't put that together yet and the div's before around and after the table are just there if we need to manipulate the position of the table or if you need to make a full width header / footer.

<strong>The code that is being put in are these elements, aside from the body and head tag.</strong>

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" media="all">
	<script type="text/javascript">var _gaq = _gaq || [];_gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-39065088-1']);_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);(function() {var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);})();
	</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	<?php include("global-nav.php"); ?>
	<div class="header-repeater"></div>
	<div class="body">
		<table style="display: inline-table;" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="1200">
			<!-- Table generated by fireworks -->
		</table>
	</div>
	<div class="footer-repeater"></div>
	</body>


##Where to put it...

be sure replace the <strong>SLICES.XTT</strong> in the dreamweaver folder which you can find here:

	terminal path:
	/Applications/Adobe\ Fireworks\ CS6/Configuration/HTML\ Code/Dreamweaver
	general path:
	/Applications/Adobe Fireworks CS6/Configuration/HTML Code/Dreamweaver

<sub><sup>You can probably use it in the other export types but to be safe this is where it is working for me.</sup></sub>

After you've replaced the slices.xtt file with this one or made the original a backup you should do these checks to make sure that you are exporting for the default set up.

##Usage

###Step one:

Check your export default settings to be configured to the figure below:

###Step Two:

Check and make sure your Option Settings are as follows:

#####General Tab

Make sure that the HTML setting is set to Dreamweaver HTML (if you put it in a different export folder use that one instead).

Change the extension to .php save yourself some time since you'll need them as php files for the global nav include to work.

And don't forget to change page alignment to center.

#####Table Tab

This is where we want to make sure that the tables are nested and have no borders otherwise it could look really messed up and floods the html with unnecessary spacers it generates

#####Document Specific Tab

Here's where we get our unique naming for the slicing between slices we make / name in fireworks. You can use this setting if you'd like as I find it works really well for me, otherwise fireworks might want to overwrite images that may get exported with the same name.
